Installation
------------

Once your cloned the repository, you are pretty much good to go.
But if you have bower installed, it is advised to first run

    $ bower update

to update the dependencies. Then simply use the Webserver of your choice to deliver the files.

TODO
----

- Cleanup HTML and main.js and suitable design patterns for Angular Controllers
- Implemented pretty much the whole functionality
- Revise the flexboxes and layout containers to be more clear.
